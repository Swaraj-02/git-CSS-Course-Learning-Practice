        <h1>Corruption within India’s Judicial System</h1>
        <p>
            Whether it be bribery, getting a desired day in court, or any sort of unjust practice to sway the results of
            a trial, India’s judicial system remains as one riddled with corruption from many sides. Lawyers,
            administrative staff, judges, defendants, and more have used these practices to sway countless cases, and
            exist at all levels of the court system. While the Indian Supreme Court is generally reserved for the cases
            of highest importance or urgency, because of petitions and the implementation of bribery, the public or
            individuals outside the Supreme Court have been able to decide what cases go to the highest court of law in
            India. At least at the High Court level, one step below the Supreme Court, corrupt judges can be impeached
            under the Judges inquiry Act of 1968, but have to have support of at least 100 members of the Lok Sabha or
            50 members of the Upper House of Parliament, or Rajya Sabha. <br>

            50 members of the Upper House of Parliament, or Rajya Sabha. <br>The worst part to this is the secretive,
            whispered insinuations of this occurring is almost the only punishment, as many of the justices who have
            been caught in a corrupt practice have been able to step down with little or no repercussions. One of the
            first instances of punishing corrupt judges was in May 2017 when Honorable Justice C. S. Karnan was found
            guilty of contempt of the court, and only punished because of making allegations against the court
            afterward. He was sentenced to 6 months in prison, and has happened again somewhat recently, but definitely
            is not common, where in lower courts corruption is more openly exposed.
